# viash tutorial - part 1

## Introduction

Tutorial to illustrate [viash] and how [viash] fits into the workflow of a broad audience.

## Contents

This is part 1, it deals with the explanation of the use-case, how this would be tackled the classical way  and what [viash] can do to ease the process:

```{r vignettes, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
readmes <- list.files(".", pattern = "README.Rmd", recursive = TRUE)
readmes <- readmes[grepl("^[^/]*/[^/]*$", readmes)] # filter out only direct readmes
for (readme in readmes) {
  lines <- readr::read_lines(readme)
  title1 <- lines[grepl("^title:", lines)][[1]]
  title <- gsub("^.*\"(.*)\"", "\\1", title1)
  html <- gsub("Rmd$", "html", readme)
  pdf <- gsub("Rmd$", "pdf", readme)
  
  folder <- gsub("/.*", "", readme)
  cat("* [", title, "](", folder, ") ([html](", html, "), [pdf](", pdf, "))\n", sep = "")
}
```

In part 2 we start from the above and run the pipeline in NextFlow, and on Kubernetes.
