# Conclusion
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# set default chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = "",
  collapse = TRUE,
  prompt = TRUE,
  cache = T
  # engine.opts = list(bash = "-l")
)
```

This concludes part 1 of the [viash] workshop and tutorial. Not all aspects of [viash] have been covered:

- directly running from a remote location `viash run https://...`
- the integrated [viash] config format where config and script are stored in one file
- advanced troubleshooting and testing scenarios
- using [viash] for CI/CD purposes

There is also one big topic that _will_ be covered in part 2 of this workshop/tutorial: Converting components/namespaces to [NextFlow] modules.
