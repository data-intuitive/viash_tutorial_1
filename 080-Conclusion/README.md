title: Viash Workshop 1 - Conclusion
---

This concludes part 1 of the
[viash](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash) workshop and tutorial.
Not all aspects of [viash](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash) have
been covered:

-   directly running from a remote location `viash run https://...`
-   the integrated [viash](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash)
    config format where config and script are stored in one file
-   advanced troubleshooting and testing scenarios
-   using [viash](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash) for CI/CD
    purposes

There is also one big topic that *will* be covered in part 2 of this
workshop/tutorial: Converting components/namespaces to \[NextFlow\]
modules.
