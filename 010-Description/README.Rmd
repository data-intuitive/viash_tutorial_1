# Setting the stage for viash

The application domain of [viash] is not limited to just biomedical research. In this workshop, we will solve one of our pet peeves in a video game called Sid Meier's Civilization.

## Background on Civilization
Civilization is a series of six video strategy games where players oversee the development of a civilization, starting from the dawn of civilizations until present times. Not only is the series famous for having defined a lot of the game mechanics in the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), it is also frequently associated with the "One More Turn Syndrome".

## Post-game replay map
Multiplayer games can take a few hours to finish -- anywhere between 2 to 10 hours, depending on who you're playing with. 
That's why a perfect way of closing a session of Civilization V is by being able to watch a 'postgame map replay' of which owner owned which time at any given point in time.

However, for whatever reason, this feature did not make it in Civilization VI. This made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. <!-- quoting Douglas Adams here -->

## Rendering post-game replay maps
At Data Intuitive, we're all about alleviating people's suffering, so we developed a few scripts for rendering a postgame video for Civilization VI using open-source tools. 
It works by letting the game automatically creates saves for every turn of the game (called 'autosaves'). An autosave contains all the information to resume the game from that point in time.
Since the information that we need is stored in a format, we need scripts to: 1. extract the information from the binary format (in JavaScript), 2. generate a map visualisation (in R), 3. convert all the visualisations into a video (with ImageMagick and ffmpeg).

You can see the general workflow for generating a postgame replay video in the diagram below.

In the next sections, we briefly discuss how each component works, as it will be used later on in the workshop.

## Step 1: Generate input files

Start up Civilization VI and go into the settings menu. You need to configure Civilization VI to create an autosave every turn, and to keep all autosaves as normally only the 10 latest autosaves are kept.

Your first task in this workshop is to play a game of Civilization VI, yay! See you in a few hours! Don't forget to come back for the remainder of this workshop!

...

...

Just kidding. We did the fun part and already created autosaves for you. If you check the `data` folder, you will see five autosave files.

```{bash, }
ls -l data
```

## Step 2, `parse_header`: Extract game info

So how do we parse the binary Civ6Save data format? Luckily, by the miracles of open-source software development, 
GitHub users Mike "mrosack" Rosack and Tuomas "iqqmuT" Jaakola already developed a tool for extracting which
players are playing which civilizations. You can install their software by running the following command.

Note that you do not need to install these commands yourself, as we will see in a later part of the workshop how to do
this more easily with viash!

```bash
npm install civ6-save-parser
```

You can view which players are playing the game by running the following command:
```{bash}
node node_modules/civ6-save-parser/index.js data/AutoSave_0159.Civ6Save --simple | head -20
```

The output is a json file, which you save as follows.
```bash
node node_modules/civ6-save-parser/index.js data/AutoSave_0159.Civ6Save --simple > data/AutoSave_0159.json
```

## `parse_map`: Extract map info

Alright, so we know which games are playing the game, but which tiles do they own? As there are no ready to use npm packages available to do this specific task, we had to write this functionality in JavaScript ourselves. The scripts `helper.js` and `script.js` are based on work by Lucien "lucienmaloney" Maloney on GitHub. 

`script.js`:
```js
let par = {
  'input': 'data/AutoSave_0159.Civ6Save',
  'output': 'data/AutoSave_0159.tsv'
}

// read helper libraries & functions
const fs = require("fs");
const helper = require("helper.js");

// read data from file
const json = helper.savetomap(fs.readFileSync(par["input"]));

// convert to tsv
const headers = Object.keys(json.tiles[0]);
const header = headers.join("\t") + "\n";
const lines = json.tiles.map(o => {
  return Object.values(o).map(b => JSON.stringify(b)).join("\t") + "\n";
});
const tsvLines = header + lines.join('')

// save to file
fs.writeFileSync(par["output"], tsvLines);
```

`helper.js`:
```js
const zlib = require('zlib');

/**
 * Output a decompressed buffer from the primary zlib zip of the .Civ6Save file
 * @param {Buffer} savefile
 * @return {Buffer} decompressed
 */
function decompress(savefile) {
  // ... omitted for the sake of clarity ...
}

/**
 * Convert compressed tile data in .Civ6Save file into json format
 * @param {buffer} savefile
 * @return {object} tiles
 */
function savetomap(savefile) {
  // ... omitted for the sake of clarity ...
}

module.exports = {
  decompress,
  savetomap
}
```


## `plot_map`: Generate map visualisation

Setup:
```R
install.packages(c("ggforce", "yaml", "bit64", "ggnewscale", "cowplot", "devtools"))
devtools::install("rcannood/civ6saves")
```

Execute:
```R
library(tidyverse)
library(ggforce)
library(civ6saves)
library(bit64)
library(cowplot)
library(yaml)
library(ggnewscale)

par <- list(
  yaml = "data/AutoSave_0159.yaml",
  tsv = "data/AutoSave_0159.tsv",
  output = "data/AutoSave_0159.pdf"
)

# read header information
map_data <- readr::read_lines(par$yaml)

# read map information
map_data$MAP <- read_tsv(par$tsv, col_types = cols(.default = "c")) 

# do some in between processing (omitted for the sake of this tutorial)
... 

# create plot
plot <-
  plot_empty_map(map_data) +
  ggforce::geom_regon(aes(fill = terrain_name), alpha = alpha) +
  geom_text(aes(label = "^"), tab_static %>% filter(terrain_form == "Hill"), alpha = alpha) +
  geom_text(aes(label = "^"), tab_static %>% filter(terrain_form == "Mountain"), fontface = "bold", alpha = alpha) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = xa, xend = xb, y = ya, yend = yb), colour = feature_palette[["River"]], rivers, size = 1, alpha = alpha) +
  ggforce::geom_regon(aes(r = civ6saves:::xy_ratio * .9), tab %>% filter(feature_name == "Ice"), fill = feature_palette[["Ice"]], alpha = .4) +
  labs(
    title = paste0("Turn ", map_data$GAME_TURN, " - ", tolower(gsub("MAPSIZE_", "", map_data$MAP_SIZE))),
    subtitle = paste0(players$leader_name, collapse = ", "),
    fill = "Terrain"
  )

# save map to file
ggsave(par$output, plot, width = 24, height = 13)
```

Some (actually, a lot) of code was omitted from the above script. You can view the full script [here](src/civ6_save_renderer/plot_map/script.R).



## `convert_plot`: Convert PDF to PNG

Setup:
```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

Convert:
```bash
convert data/AutoSave_0159.pdf -flatten data/AutoSave_0159.png
```

## `combine_plots`: Create movie

Setup:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Convert:
```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 4 -i "concat:data/AutoSave_0159.png|data/AutoSave_0002.png|..." -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -y "data/Movie.webm"
```

## Enter viash, stage left

While we at Data Intuitive can now happily churn out postgame videos of all of our Civilization VI, installing the requirements on a different system is a hassle.
Because of the complicated software requirements, and because of its pipeline-like workflow, this application is serves as a perfect example of why and how to use [viash].
